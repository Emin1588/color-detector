# valorant-cheat
Valorant cheat that abuses Logitech GHUB driver input management.

# how does it work?
Way this cheat works is that it detects the outline color of the enemy players
and according to the feature that is enabled, does what it's supposed to do.

# features
  - Triggerbot with customizable delay (VK_SHIFT)
  - Low FOV aimbot
  - Humanized recoil control system with customizable recoil reduction amount

# requirements
This cheat requires Logitech GHUB driver to be installed on the machine that is
running the game/cheat. You can download it for free at https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html.
You don't need a Logitech mouse, even though it can be buggy on other mice.

# detection rate
I've been occasionally using this cheat since the beta on a test account and on my main (got 2 keys, lucky :3)
and I've never even gotten a warning or a ban on those accounts. They are still alive to this day.
No reading/writing memory, just moving your mouse.. can't ban for that? :)

# IMPORTANT
Since this project will be released to the public soon enough, you must know that there are certain risks of a 
Riot developer stumbling upon this. I am not responsible for any bans/penalties you receive on your accounts.
Updating this cheat isn't hard, if you have more than 2 braincells you will be able to use it for a loooong time.
My name on VALORANT is **malbasic #CHEAT**. (EU)
